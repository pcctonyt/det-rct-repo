                    <p>2. The opponent landing on that square removes it from the Game Board and scores that Unit's 4.0 Cash Value Points to his/her Score Sheet Game Points Total.</p>
                    <p>3. The player losing the MTN to capture deducts 4.0 Cash Value Points from his/her Cash Value Points Total on the Score Sheet.</p>
                    <p>4. The destroyed squares in a Firing Move become Fallout Squares, off-limits to all ground-landing Units.</p>

                    <p>1. To Fire (F) a Nuclear Unit, it must have been previously Armed.</p>
                    <p>2. Armed Units can be fired unaccompanied within given ranges.</p>
                    <p>3. The Unit fired is removed from the board and the firing player deducts those Cash Value Points from his/her Cash Value Game Points Total on the Score Sheet (for Mobile Units).</p>
                    <p>4. The other player's destroyed Units are removed from the Game Board and all the resulting Cash Value Points are deducted as above at that time.</p>
                    <p>5. All applicable Score Sheet Game Points and Cash Value Game Points must be tallied by both players during the Firing Player's Turn.</p>
                    <p>6. Nuclear Units cannot destroy any Units on squares protected by Fixed SDI Defense Units.</p>
                    <p>7. Nuclear Units cannot destroy a Unit paired with a Mobile SDI Defense Unit</p>
                    <p>8. Nuclear Units can destroy both friendly and opposing Units (sacrifices).</p>
                    <p>9. Only 1 total Tactical or Intermediate Nuclear Unit of either type is allowed.  The Player Deploying (D) selects either a Mobile or Fixed type at that time, and that CANNOT BE changed later.</p>
                    <p>10. The Tactical Nuclear Unit type Deploys (D) during Complete Turns #1-#10, inclusive.</p>
                    <p>11. All Deployed (D) Nuclear Units have a Complete Turn wait time before being Activated (C), non-inclusive of those two Turns.  This time limit can be changed during Treaty negotiations; the <em className="bold">Default Setting</em> is: 5-Turn Wait.</p>
