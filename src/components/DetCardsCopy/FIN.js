                    <p>4. The destroyed squares in a Firing Move become Fallout Squares, off-limits to all ground-landing Units, if no SDI Defense Units are present on that/those square(s).  The Nuclear Unit is then removed from the Game Board.</p>

                    <p>1. To Fire (F) a Nuclear Unit, it must have been previously Armed (R).</p>
                    <p>2. Armed Units can be Fired (F) unaccompanied within given ranges.</p>
                    <p>3. The Unit fired is removed from the board and the firing player loses those Cash Value Points (for Mobile Units).</p>
                    <p>4. The other player's destroyed Units are removed from the board and all the resulting Cash Value Points are lost.</p>
                    <p>5. All applicable Score Sheet Game Points must be tallied by both players.</p>
                    <p>6. Nuclear Units cannot destroy ANY Units on squares protected by Fixed SDI Defense Units.</p>
                    <p>7. Nuclear Units can destroy both friendly and opposing Units (sacrifices).</p>
                    <p>8. Only 1 total Tactical or Intermediate Nuclear Unit of either type is allowed.  The Player Deploying (D) selects either a Mobile or Fixed type at that time, and that CANNOT BE changed later.</p>
                    <p>9. The Intermediate Nuclear Unit type Deploys (D) during Complete Turns #11-#20, inclusive.</p>
                    <p>10. All Deployed (D) Nuclear Units have a Complete Turn wait time before being Activated (C), non-inclusive of those two Turns.  This time limit can be changed during Treaty negotiations; the <em className="bold">Default Setting</em> is: 5-Turn Wait.</p>
