                <p>This Order Code indicates when a Player ends Treaty Negotiations requested from the other Player in either Round and a Treaty is NOT AGREED TO.  The Player using this Order Code either rejects a Treaty outright or the negotiations do not produce a valid Treaty (where both players agree to make EXACTLY THE SAME changes).  Deterrence's Fixed Rules (see Official Rules: Fixed vs Variable Rules) cannot be changed.  This Order Code ALWAYS COUNTS as one COMPLETE TURN, since the immediate Turn resumes the Game as usual.</p>
