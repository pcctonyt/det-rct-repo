                <p>This Code allows for any type of Conventional Unit other than the President Unit or the Infantry Units to be declared as that Player's one allowed (no more than 1) current Envoy Unit, giving that Unit the power to Arm (R) previously Activated friendly Nuclear Units at a distance.  Since the President Unit (P) can only move one square total at a time, the President can only arm Nuclear Units on adjacent squares to its present resting square.  The President Unit DOES NOT need to be declared an Envoy, since that Unit already has the power to arm.  With the EXCEPTION of Complete Turns with Protect the President Move Elements (O-O or O-O-O), declaring an Envoy ALWAYS COUNTS as one Complete Turn.  The maximum number of times (inclusive) during a game each Player may declare an Envoy to replace a previously lost (captured (x) or destroyed (z)) Envoy can be changed during Treaty negotiations.  The Default Setting is: 1 TIME.  The Conventional Unit selected has to already be present on the Game Board to be declared as an Envoy.  No new Conventional Unit can be placed on the Game Board.  The Envoy's arming RANGE is the same as its movement RANGE (arming moves have to be legally able to be made as actual movement).  The new Score Sheet Unit Code of (E) for the Envoy replaces the prior Unit Code and is used for the duration of the game as long as that Unit remains on the Game Board. </p>

Score Sheet Complete Turn entry example: <em>E=d1</em>  A General (or other qualifying Unit, for that matter) resting on square d1 is now that Player's new Envoy, and is referred to as "the Envoy" henceforth. ANOTHER EXAMPLE (two ways to record the Complete Turn): 1. O-O,<em>E=f1</em> or 2. <em>E=h1</em>,O-O  The Starting Player Protects his/her President Short Side while declaring that Lieutenant to be that Player's new Envoy, and that Unit is referred to as "the Envoy" henceforth.  Both Score Sheet Complete Turn entries are legal in this case.</p>
