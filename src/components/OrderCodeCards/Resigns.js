After this Order Element Code is used, the game ends immediately, and both Players must tally ALL GAME POINTS (both Score Sheet and Cash Value) to determine the outcome for assigning the second Outcome Point (see Official Rules: Score Sheet Rules, for more information).</p>

This Code only refers directly to the first Outcome Point for the positional part of the game.  However, the game does end immediately when <em>Resigns</em> is entered on the Score Sheet, and it cannot succeed any other prior Move or Order Elements in that one Complete Turn.  It DOES COUNT as a Complete Turn in and of itself, and must be used on that Player's turn.</p>
