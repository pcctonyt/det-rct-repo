                <p>This Order Code indicates when a Player requests Treaty Negotiations from the other Player.  One, some, or all of either the Variable Rules or the Points Settings may be changed.  The Deterrence Official Treaty Negotiations Chart determines which Variable Rules and Points Settings these are.  This Order Code ALWAYS COUNTS as one COMPLETE TURN, since the immediate Turn will use one of the ENEG- Order Codes to reveal how the negotiations fared.  Each Player has but ONE OPPORTUNITY to use this Order Code throughout the entire Game.</p>
