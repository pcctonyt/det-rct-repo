                <p>This Order Element allows one Player to challenge any one, two, or three Move Elements in the IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING Complete Turn as illegal.  If AT LEAST ONE of the Elements listed in the opposing Player's just completed turn is found to be illegal when the Rules and/or Treaty is(are) checked, the entire Complete Turn is illegal, and must be retracted, and then that player attempts another Complete Turn after the other Player's IMD-S turn.  This Order Element ALWAYS COUNTS as one Complete Turn.  The Player using IMD-S then applies the Points Setting amount to his/her Score Sheet Game Points Total at that time.  The Default Setting in the Treaty is +5.0 Points.  NOTE:  Illegal here refers to any of both Fixed Rules (which do not change) or Variable Rules (which can be changed during Treaty negotiations), inaccurate amounts of Points applied (where applicable), illegal use of other Movement, Unit, and/or other Order Codes, and Out-of-Order Move Element listing errors.  These errors occur when the order of the Move Elements listed on the Score Sheet during that Complete Turn does not match what the position in the game at that point allows for.</p>

                        <p><span className="bold">When to use:</span><span className="right">When wishing to declare any JUST COMPLETED portion of the opposing Player's Complete Turn illegal, use the Order Code portion (IMD-) on the Score Sheet, and then place the (S) after the hyphen when any portion of either type of Rules or the Treaty Negotiations Chart prove that any part of that Complete Turn is indeed illegal.  Just as in NFL football, the challenging of a prior turn must occur BEFORE any other Complete Turns by either Player occur.  Any Treaty in effect still remains in effect regardless of the Illegal Move Declared - Complete Turn outcome.</span></p>

                    <div className="divider lg"></div>
                        <p className="note">NOTE:  Out-of-Order Move Element listing errors usually occur during Complete Turns using Hand-Off Move Elements, Arming Move Elements, or Protect-the-President Move Elements.  For example, if a previously Activated Nuclear Unit is not in that Envoy's legal movement RANGE until AFTER the Envoy moves to its new resting square, place the Arming Move Element AFTER the Envoy's Move Element indicating movement.  The same advice applies to the listing order of Hand Off Move Elements and Protect the President Move Elements that could affect the legality of Arming Move Elements occurring during that Complete Turn.  Be CAREFUL!</p>
