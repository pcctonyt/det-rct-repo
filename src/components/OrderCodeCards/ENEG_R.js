                <p>This Order Code indicates when a Player ends Treaty negotiations requested from the other Player in the 2nd Round and a Treaty is AGREED TO which REVISES the Variable Rules and Points Settings agreed to in the prior 1st Treaty.  The Player using this Order Code must validate the other Player's Treaty proposal by ensuring that all changes agreed to during negotiations exist on both Players' Treaty Negotiations Charts.  Counteroffers can occur during negotiations, but the changes to the Variable Rules and Points Settings must be EXACTLY the same in the end.  Deterrence's Fixed Rules (see Official Rules: Fixed vs Variable Rules) cannot be changed. This procedure produces a valid Revised Treaty (the second of two possible Treaties ), and then those changes agreed to TAKE EFFECT on the immediately following COMPLETE TURN, replacing altogether the 1st Treaty.  This Order Code ALWAYS COUNTS as one COMPLETE TURN, since the following Turn resumes the Game as usual.</p>

                        <p>3.  Both Players reach an agreement on EXACTLY THE SAME changes to be made and a Treaty is therefore adopted ((ENEG-Y) for the 1st round of negotiations, (ENEG-R) for the 2nd round if replacing a 1st Treaty, or (ENEG-Y) in the @nd Round if there was not a 1st Treaty adopted in the 1st Round).</p>
