                <div className="divider"></div>
                <p>This Code allows for either Player to protect that Player's President Unit ONLY ONE TIME throughout the course of the game.  The Protect the President - Short Move Element Code (O-O) requires the use of that Player's a-file Lieutenant Unit and the President Unit BOTH MOVING during ONE MOVE ELEMENT (the code above) during ONE COMPLETE TURN.  The result is a change to the position whereby the President Unit rests on square c1 for the Starting Player, c8 for the Responding Player.  Also changed is the Lieutenant Unit for each Player starting on the a-file resting on square d1 for the Starting Player and d8 for the Responding Player, all in the one Move Element, within only one Complete Turn (there are other Move Elements which may occur, but do not have to, alongside this Move Element, within the selected Complete Turn).  The conditions for when this Move Element Code may be used are in the below section.  There are many conditions to consider before attempting this Move Element.  In the game of chess, this "move" is referred to as "castling queenside."</p>
