      <h1>Deterrence Official Rules for Nuclear Units and SDI Defense Units</h1>
      <h2>Fixed Nuclear Unit Rules:</h2>
      <p>A Fixed Nuclear Unit must remain on the square it was Deployed (D) to for the duration of the game.  It cannot be moved, Handed Off (HO), Picked Up (PU), or Dropped Off (DO).  If an opposing Conventional Unit lands on a square occupied by a Fixed Nuclear Unit, that Fixed Nuclear Unit is considered destroyed, in which case that Unit is taken off of the Game Board and the attacking Player's Conventional Unit assumes control of that square.  The attacking Player receives no Cash Value Points.  The Move Element indicating this must use the "destroys" (z) Operator Code on the Score Sheet for that Complete Turn that Move Element was executed on.  The Player who got that Fixed Nuclear Unit destroyed cannot use or re-deploy that destroyed unit.  Fixed Nuclear Units "block" ground-level attacks by opposing Conventional Units.  Fixed Tactical Nuclear Units (FTN) pair only with friendly Infantry Units.  Any other friendly Units of other types besides a paired SDI Defense Unit cannot share a square with a Fixed Tactical Nuclear Unit.  Fixed Intermediate Nuclear Units (FIN) pair only with friendly Units besides the Infantry Unit or the President Unit.  Any other friendly Units of other types besides a paired SDI Defense Unit cannot share a square with a Fixed Intermediate Nuclear Unit.  Strategic Nuclear Units (SN) pair only with the friendly President Unit.  the Strategic Nuclear Unit can only be deployed to the square currently being occupied by that Player's President Unit.  Any other friendly Units of other types besides a paired SDI Defense Unit cannot share a square with a Strategic Nuclear Unit.</p>
